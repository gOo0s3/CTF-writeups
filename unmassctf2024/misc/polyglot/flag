UMASS{us1ng_4_tcp_t1me0ut_t0_d3t3ct_ftp_l0l}

Description:
I've created a HTTP server that serves not just HTTP but
also a few other protocols. Can you find the flag?
http://polygot.ctf.umasscybersec.org/

Solution:
We go to the website link, and see this text:


Hello! Welcome to my website!

I've created a basic HTTP server in Go.
Isn't that cool? But that is not just just all,
my HTTP server is more than just a HTTP server.
It's a polyglot so to say! See if you can find the secrets beneath it.
I will say that when it is an option, I tend to prefer to
implement things passively >.<

So we _go_ ahead and check for other protocols, such as FTP for example:

$ nc polygot.ctf.umasscybersec.org 80
220 Welcome to the Go FTP Server

There's an FTP server served on port 80 too.
So we can go ahead and connect to haylin's account with (trying) password "anonymous":

sudo ftp ftp://haylin:anonymous@polygot.ctf.umasscybersec.org:80

We get all the files from the FTP server that we can find (I put all of them in the "files" directory).
One of those files is an ssh private key! bingo B-)

$ ssh haylin@polygot.ctf.umasscybersec.org -i id_ed25519 -p 80
You found my SSH server! Welcome!
SSH Key Used: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAINVBSiDCCv2zW3hYOnAQs7sze1rV/nLRvTcJ71Ivy5Vt

Oh! Hey Haylin, here's the key UMASS{us1ng_4_tcp_t1me0ut_t0_d3t3ct_ftp_l0l}
Connection to polygot.ctf.umasscybersec.org closed.

And there we go
