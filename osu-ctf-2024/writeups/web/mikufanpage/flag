osu{miku_miku_miku_miku_miku_miku_miku_miku_miku_miku_miku_miku_miku}

so this challenge has a pretty obvious path traversal vuln
Going through the source code with ctrl+u you can see the website pulls all images through the /images dir
but specifies a path GET parameter.

This parameter holds the name of the file you try to pull
such as miku1.jpg

however, since we have the source code, we see that it validates
this path parameter by just checking that the path.split(".")[1]
is png or jpg.

this can be manipulated as such:

path=bullshit.png.whatever/../flag.txt

and this gives out the flag when you visit the page
