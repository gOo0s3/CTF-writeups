Description:
"Found a glitch on youtube!

https://youtu.be/oQZuaI8SxXw"


Going to the video, we see a lot of black and white (kinda qr-like) frames.

Sean gave me this writeup from a different ctf:
https://medium.com/@brutal_panda/youtube-go-brrr-ethiopia-cybershield-showdown-ctf-9e2e006cd9d3

In this writeup, it's the exact same challenge as this one.
The challenge maker used this tool from github:
https://github.com/DvorakDwarf/Infinite-Storage-Glitch

To make a video with the flag embeded into it, and then uploaded it to youtube.

Neat, so we download the tool, and just use it,
And extracting from the video the encoded info, we get a zip archive,
which then if we unzip, we get a flag.png file.

Opening up the image within an image viewer gives us the flag.
