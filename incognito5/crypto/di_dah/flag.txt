"Beneath flickering lights, echoes play their games,
In voltage's fluctuations, telegraph's silent claims."

Looking through enc.txt we see a whole bunch of "di"s "dit"s and "dah"s.
If you read them out it sounds a lot like morse code; dah for a dash and di/dit for a dot.

I wrote a python script that transalted the 'di's and 'dah's to actual morse code with dashes and dots.

[TODO: actually write the script]

I then took the morse code output and pasted it into cyberchef to decode from morse code.
After doing so we get a string of a bunch of numbers and letters,
which cyberchef automatically figured out was hex encoding.

Decoding from hex gets the flag:
