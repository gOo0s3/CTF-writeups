Description:
Delve into binary operations, where math meets magic

Solution:
"Binary operations" lead me to suspect we're talking about XOR here,
as it's very common to see in crypto challenges.

I pasted the contents of the given enc.txt into cyberchef:
https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#input=eWN9dntRIFJWUnI5ZWdhZF9QIHVWWDN7Iz90&oeol=CR

and used the XOR filter with the known start of the flag,
so XORing the encrypted flag with the start of the known flag ("ictf{"):

https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=XOR(%7B'option':'UTF8','string':'ictf%7B'%7D,'Standard',false)To_Hex('Space',0)&input=eWN9dntRIFJWUnI5ZWdhZF9QIHVWWDN7Iz90&oeol=CR

(after XORing I took the hex of the result)


As we can see at the start, we get in hex:
10 00 09 10 00 38 ...

The first 5 hex values here are the start of our key,
and it seems like it's going to be the first 3 hex values: 10 00 09 repeating,
as the second half 10 00 are just the start of the same key.

So we try to XOR the original contents of enc.txt with 10 00 09 and we get the flag:

https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=XOR(%7B'option':'Hex','string':'10%2000%2009'%7D,'Standard',false)&input=eWN9dntRIFJWUnI5ZWdhZF9QIHVWWDN7Iz90&oeol=CR
