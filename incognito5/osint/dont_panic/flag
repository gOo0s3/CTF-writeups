Description:
"One of our agent was able to get the username "GlitchyBagel42", you know what's next ü§∑‚Äç"

It is a twitter username:
https://twitter.com/GlitchyBagel42

Looking at their bio we see:
"Always curious.
I talk about very random ABs2 cGFzdGViaW4uY29tL2h5d1ZyWHFR PkdfidkDpokmJsQ,
oops, my thoughts jump around a lot, got dyslexia."

"cGFzdGViaW4uY29tL2h5d1ZyWHFR" is a base64 encoded link:
pastebin.com/hywVrXqQ

Going there, it requires a password.
Checking out the tweets of this user we see one saying:

"In my world, names aren't just cool, they unlock secrets. Like, literally. üòâ"

The twitter username is Pixel Quokka @GlitchyBagel42
So we try Pixel Quokka as the password for pastebin, and it works.

The pastebin post is a list of a LOT of flags.
Impossible to know which one is the right one...

However, looking back at the tweets we see a tweet saying:
"Playing with words tonight -

Among the flags, a single key,
"Mystery" solves miseries, you'll see.
In the vast web, it quietly resides,
Seek its whisper, where truth abides."

So we're looking for a keyword here, "mystery".
All the flags are in 1337 speak tho, so let's 1337ify this:
"my5t3ry"

Looking through the flags using ctrl+f in the browser,
the one and only flag containing "my5t3ry" is the 736th flag:
ictf{p1x3L_hUnT3R_My5t3ry}

So we try and submit this flag, and it's indeed correct.
