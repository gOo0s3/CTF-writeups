# CTF-writeups
My writeups for challenges me and my CTF group (C7r1-417-31337) solved in various CTFs &amp; my own writeups for various other challenges I have solved on my own

# Note
Some of the writeups are not fully complete. There may be some flag files which just contain the flag itself with no explenation on how the challenge was solved. This was done on mostly challenges that were either very trivial to solve, or that the writeup was going to be very long and we didn't have time to write one during the ctf and forgot about it :P
