Basically SansAlpha (from picoCTF 2024) but with actual source code and a little less guessing where files are.

Trying to simply run '*' will show that the flag.txt file is in the current dir and is the first match.
Just to be sure, we'll run *.??? because there are a bunch of files here probably, so that's best.
It should (possibly) reduce the number of matches for the wildcard expression to be just 1 - the flag.txt file.

we're gonna run /bin/base32 on the file like so:

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc chal.amt.rs 2100
$ /???/????32 *.???
