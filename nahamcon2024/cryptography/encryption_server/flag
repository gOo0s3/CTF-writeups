flag{29070b0688f398587d41041f4b25d8a3}

Description:
I read online it's bad to re-use the prime numbers in RSA. So, I made this server that randomly generates them for me. 

Solution:
I am pretty sure my solution was not intended but here it is anyway;

In the source code for the server we see the public exponent is a randomly generated integer between 500 and 1000.
We can easily find this by bruteforce given N and the first char of the encrypted array for the flag chars.
[See my script's beginning for calculating e]

After figuring out e, we know the flag characters are gonna be either lowercase letters, digits, or curly braces.
So that's our character set, which is again easy enough to bruteforce using our known N and e.

We just go character by character and bruteforce it like in the script.
