Description:
"I found this file on a USB drive that was left by somebody
after the last club meeting. I'm not at my computer right
now so I can't open the archive myself. Would you mind
looking through the archive to figure out what's on it?"


Solution:
Use this python program to unzip all the zip files recursively:

import os
import zipfile

def extract_zip(zip_file_path, folder_name):
    # Extract zip file
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
        zip_ref.extractall(folder_name)

    # Check for zip files inside the extracted files
    for file in os.listdir(folder_name):
        if file.endswith(".zip"):
            # Create new folder with same name as extracted zip file
            new_folder = os.path.join(folder_name, file[:-4])
            os.mkdir(new_folder)

            # Extract the next level of zip files
            zip_path = os.path.join(folder_name, file)
            extract_zip(zip_path, new_folder)

# Set the path of your first zip file
root_zip_path = "hole.zip"
root_folder = "."
# Extract the root zip file
extract_zip(root_zip_path, root_folder)


Then use this command to cat all the rabbit files to a single txt file:

$ find . -type f -name 'rabbit' -exec cat {} + > concatenated_rabbit_files.txt


Then you can search this txt file for the flag:

$ strings concatenated_rabbit_files.txt | grep spartanCTF
