description:
Network Security Sam set up a password protection script.
He made it load the real password from an unencrypted text file and compare it to the password the user enters.
However, he neglected to upload the password file...


so there's no password file, right?
Does this mean the password that would get accepted will literally just be an empty string?
I mean, if it doesn't exist, then surely an empty password would be equal to the content's of the file lol

and if you try this out it works...
