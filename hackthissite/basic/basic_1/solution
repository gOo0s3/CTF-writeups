password: f96e6cc6

we get a page that asks us for a password.
But we don't know any passwords.

So we go take a look at the source code with ctrl+u
we get kinda bombarded with a lot of html,
so we use ctrl+f to search for the word 'password'
to see stuff related to the password.

within the html, we find this comment:
<!-- the first few levels are extremely easy: password is f96e6cc6 -->

and that's how we get the password.
we enter it into the page, and it tells us we solved the challenge :)
