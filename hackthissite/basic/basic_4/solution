This time Sam hardcoded the password into the script.
However, the password is long and complex, and Sam is often forgetful.
So he wrote a script that would email his password to him automatically in case he forgot.
Here is the script:

and here there's a button that says "Send password to Sam"


right, so if we look into the network tab after pressing this send password to sam button
or just look at the request going through using burpsuite,
we can see that we send out an HTTP POST request,
and within the request data we got a parameter called to.

it's assigned this value:
to=sam%40hackthissite.org

so the post request is telling the backend which email address to send out the "i forgot my password" mail to.
So we can just put our own mail address in there using burpsuite.

If we modify the to parameter to be our own email address which we registered with into HTS,
we get the following mail from sam@hackthissite.org:

From: sam@hackthissire.org
Title: Your password reminder

Sam,
Here is the password: 'e436ece1'.


So we got Sam's password, which we can use to pass this level.
