Sam has gotten wise to all the people who wrote their own forms to get the password.
Rather than actually learn the password, he decided to make his email program a little more secure.

Right, so this challenge is a little bit weird.
For some reason, the solution is exactly the same as the previous challenge.

the only difference between these challenges that I noticed was that
this time all the requests were done on the same page..?

it seemed to have presented the output on the current page
with all the HTS css, html, etc.

anyways yeah so just open the website up in burpsuite,
intercept the post request going out after you press the button,
modify the to parameter to your own mail and send out the request,
recieve a mail telling you the password.

password:
