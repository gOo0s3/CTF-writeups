This time Network Security Sam remembered to upload the password file,
but there were deeper problems than that.


alright so now Sam did upload the password file.
Good job Sam, getting better now.

Alright, so now how do we get this pesky password?
well, we try something like 123456789 first just to kinda see what happens

we are of course led to an error page, meaning this password is wrong.
kinda expected.

Now, we could go on about trying different obvious passwords with a bruteforce attack,
but we're smarter than that B)

We check out the source code again just to take a look
perhaps any comments in there may help us out?

looking through, there's nothing interesting in there.

Alright, so we check out the requests going on using dev tools network tab
or by opening this site in burpsuite.

we see that within our HTTP POST request, where we send to the server hosting this password checking a password,
we also pass another parameter to it:

file: "password.php"
password: "123456789"


so we got the name of the password file Sam has uploaded.
We can try to see if we can access this file by adding /password.php at the end of our current url for this page.

we see that we get to a page displaying this text:
5f103a97

which sure does look like a password to me!
we try it out...
and it works!


password: 5f103a97
