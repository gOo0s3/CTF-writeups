openECSC{i_found_a_map_e1871a60}

Description:
Welcome to the blind maze, you move without knowing the outcome and maybe you will reach the end, good luck.

A previous winner left us a strange file. Maybe it will help you.

Solution:
I went to website and saw that it's behavior is not very predictable, so I gave up on trying to solve the challenge from there.
Theoretically, however, I wonder if it's solveable using some sort of path finding algorithm to solve this :thinkage:

Anyways, opening up the pcap file within wireshark, I look at the protocols being used and I see a lot of HTTP (ofc)
as this is the traffic passed when the winner of the challenge solved it.

So I suspected that if it's using HTTP and not HTTPS then the flag should just be in the packets in clear text.

I used ctrl+f and searched for the string "openECSC" within the packet bytes, and indeed came upon a packet that contained those bytes.
Following the HTTP stream looks like so:

GET /maze?direction=right HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5000
User-Agent: python-requests/2.25.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Connection: keep-alive
Cookie: session=EL-aophgdayjVp_mL9SPjoLXlxMIwE_lXR7AunrEHDY

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Connection: close

Here is the FLAG: openECSC{i_found_a_map_e1871a60}


I thought to myself that this may be a dummy flag, but after looking for more occurences of this string in packets, I saw none...
So trying to submit the flag, it worked :D
