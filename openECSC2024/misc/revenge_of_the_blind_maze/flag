Description:
Welcome back to the blind maze,
this time you'll have a harder time finding the flag, good luck.

Solution:
Looking through the pcap file again for the flag in plaintext will not work here,
what we will see when we search for the word "flag" is that when the winner
of the maze finished the maze, they got the following string:
"The flag will appear here after the start of the CTF"

We do know exactly the path the winner of the maze took in order to get to the flag,
so we can try to redo the exact same path.

I have tried writing a script to do this but it doesn't work yet for some reason....
so the way I solved the maze for now was literally manually going through the moves...

So........
#TODO: fix shitty script
