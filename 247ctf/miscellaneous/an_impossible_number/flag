In C, the max signed integer is (2^31)-1 (because integers are 32-bit, but the first bit is the int's sign).
If we add 1 to it, we get an integer overflow, and the result will be the min signed integer,
which is negative, and ofc less than the maximum.
The max signed integer is also positive, so this answers the impossible condition for the number.

we netcat to the remote address, give as input the max signed integer, 2147483647 =(2^31)-1,
and the program prints out the flag. :)
